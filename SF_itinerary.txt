Okay, I've gathered some recommendations for restaurants and museums in San Francisco. Now, let's create a 7-day itinerary focusing on dining and museums, keeping in mind the summer season and a $300/night accommodation budget.

**Accommodation:**

Since your budget is $300/night, I recommend looking at hotels in neighborhoods like Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, or Nob Hill. These areas offer a mix of hotels within your budget and are centrally located for easy access to attractions. Consider hotels like:

*   **Hotel Nikko San Francisco:** Modern hotel in Union Square with good reviews.
*   **Argonaut Hotel:** Boutique hotel in Fisherman's Wharf with a nautical theme.
*   **The Hotel Vertigo:** A unique hotel near Nob Hill with a stylish design.

Alternatively, you could explore Airbnb for apartments within your budget, especially if you prefer more space or kitchen facilities.
